# Assignment 3 â€” Optimization of a City Transportation Network (Minimum Spanning Tree)

**Course:** Design and Analysis of Algorithms  
**Language:** Java  
**Student:** *Abdikasym Nurbakyt*  
**Date:** October 2025

## Objective

The purpose of this assignment is to apply **Primâ€™s** and **Kruskalâ€™s** algorithms to optimize a cityâ€™s transportation network by determining the **minimum set of roads** that connect all city districts with the **lowest possible total construction cost**.

Each district is represented as a vertex in a weighted undirected graph,  
and each potential road between districts is represented as an edge with a cost (weight).

---

## Input Description

The program reads input data from `ass_3_input.json`.  
Each graph includes:
- `nodes`: list of city districts,
- `edges`: possible connections between them,
- `weight`: cost of building the road.

Example:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "nodes": ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E"],
  "edges": [
    {"from": "A", "to": "B", "weight": 4},
    {"from": "A", "to": "C", "weight": 3},
    {"from": "B", "to": "C", "weight": 2},
    {"from": "B", "to": "D", "weight": 5},
    {"from": "C", "to": "D", "weight": 7},
    {"from": "C", "to": "E", "weight": 8},
    {"from": "D", "to": "E", "weight": 6}
  ]
}
```

## Algorithms Implemented

### ðŸ”¹ Primâ€™s Algorithm
- Starts from one vertex and repeatedly adds the lowest-cost edge connecting the tree to a new vertex.  
- Implemented using a **priority queue (min-heap)** for efficiency.  
- Best for **dense graphs**.

### Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm
- Sorts all edges by weight and adds them one by one, skipping those that create cycles.  
- Implemented using a **Disjoint Set (Union-Find)** structure.  
- Best for **sparse graphs**.

## Results Summary

| Graph ID | Algorithm | MST Total Cost | Operations | Execution Time (ms) |
|-----------|------------|----------------|-------------|---------------------|
| 1 | Prim | 16 | 42 | 1.52 |
| 1 | Kruskal | 16 | 37 | 1.28 |
| 2 | Prim | 6 | 29 | 0.87 |
| 2 | Kruskal | 6 | 31 | 0.92 |

âœ… The **MST cost** is identical for both algorithms, confirming correctness.

## Analysis and Comparison

| Criterion | Primâ€™s Algorithm | Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm |
|------------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Approach** | Expands from one vertex outward | Adds edges in increasing order |
| **Data structure** | Priority Queue (Heap) | Union-Find (Disjoint Set) |
| **Graph Type Preference** | Dense graphs | Sparse graphs |
| **Implementation Complexity** | Moderate | Simpler |
| **Performance (from results)** | Slightly slower on small graphs | Slightly faster overall |
| **MST Total Cost** | âœ… Same | âœ… Same |

---

## Conclusions

- Both algorithms correctly generate the **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** with the **same total cost**.
- **Kruskalâ€™s** algorithm performed **slightly faster** on the tested graphs.
- **Primâ€™s** algorithm is more suitable for **dense** networks where adjacency matrices are used.
- **Kruskalâ€™s** algorithm is preferable for **sparse** or edge-list-based graphs.
- For real-world transportation planning, the choice depends on graph size and density.
